# Track 2: Functional Core & Automation

## Objective
Build the functional backbone for content aggregation and public transparency, utilizing the Vibe Kanban API and establishing a smart AI strategy for content generation.

## Tasks
- [x] **Public Roadmap Integration**:
    - [x] Create a TypeScript client (`src/lib/vibe.ts`) to fetch tasks from the local Vibe Kanban API.
    - [x] Build a server-side rendered `roadmap` page that lists tasks by status (Todo/In Progress/Done).
- [ ] **AI Strategy Deep Research**:
    - [ ] Analyze `CopilotKit` vs. custom LLM scripts for the use case: "Transforming GitHub Release Notes into Social Media Content".
    - [ ] Define the "Smartest Approach" architecture (e.g., Browser Extension vs. Server-side Agent).
- [ ] **News Aggregator Prototype**:
    - [ ] Create a prototype script/loader to fetch the latest "Release" from a specific GitHub repository (e.g., LangChain).
    - [ ] Display this raw data on a test page to verify the pipeline.

## Progress
- [x] Track initialized.
- [x] Roadmap feature implemented and integrated into the site.
