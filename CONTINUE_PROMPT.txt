Fix Instagram upload: The Next button selector in `radar/instagram.py` isn't finding the button after file upload. 

**Context:**
- Login works perfectly (9 cookies saved, account `pasca_lvangoldberg`)
- File upload to Instagram succeeds
- Debug shows buttons found: ['', 'Next', 'Aden', 'Clarendon', etc.]
- But selector can't find "Next" button

**Files to check:**
1. `radar/instagram.py` - function `_upload_media()` around line 300-350
2. `radar/selectors.py` - `INSTAGRAM_SELECTORS["next_button"]` definition
3. `debug_shots/debug_ig_021618_buttons_found_in_dialog_______.png` - screenshot showing the UI

**Task:**
Update the selector strategy to find and click the "Next" button after Instagram file upload. The button text is "Next" according to debug output.

**Test command:**
```bash
python examples/instagram_test_video.py
```

Expected: Upload completes successfully instead of "Next button did not appear" error.
