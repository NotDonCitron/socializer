# Product Guidelines

## Brand Personality
*   **Vibe:** Modern, sleek, and minimalist. The tool should feel like a high-end, reliable utility for professionals.
*   **Tone:** Technical but accessible. Avoid overly dense jargon where possible, but don't dumb down concepts.
*   **Voice:** Authoritative yet helpful. We are the experts on social media automation.

## Visual Identity
*   **Design:** Clean lines, dark mode default (preferred for developer tools), high contrast for readability.
*   **CLI Output:** Use `rich` library for beautiful, structured, and color-coded terminal output.
*   **Web Interface:** Minimalist dashboard, focus on data visualization (the "radar" aspect) and clear status indicators.

## Coding Standards
*   **Python:** Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting everywhere.
*   **Documentation:** Clear, concise, and example-driven.
