# Plan: Instagram Posting Feature

## Phase 1: Core Upload Logic (Photo)
- [x] Task: Create reproduction script to analyze Instagram Upload DOM
- [~] Task: Implement `upload_photo` method in `InstagramAutomator` (Tests first)
- [ ] Task: Handle "Crop -> Filter -> Share" multi-step flow
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Photo Upload'

## Phase 2: Refinement & Video (Optional/Later)
- [ ] Task: Add caption support (if not covered in Phase 1)
- [ ] Task: Add robust error handling for upload failures (timeouts, file type errors)
