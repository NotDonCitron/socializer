TY for the work could u givve me a quick summarize as a prompt i wana continu e im my ide now

Here is a summary of the current state and the work remaining, formatted as a prompt for you to continue in your IDE:

Task: Implement AI Agent Radar MVP (Phase 2 Improvements)

Current State:

    The project is scaffolded with Python backend (radar/) and Astro frontend (site/).
    Core functionality (fetching, scoring, rendering) is implemented.
    The radar package is installed in editable mode.
    Critical Issues:
        radar/pipeline/normalize.py keeps reverting to an old version (missing slugify), causing imports to fail.
        radar/pipeline/render.py might also be outdated (missing permalink logic).
        The verification script verify_v2.py is failing because of these missing updates.

Goal: Complete the implementation of the "Fastest Quality Jump" improvements:

    Internal Permalinks: Ensure render.py generates slugified filenames and valid internal permalinks (/updates/...).
    Weekly Digests: Ensure weekly.py links to these internal permalinks.
    Major Bump Detection: Ensure cli.py and score.py correctly compare against the previous version in DB.

Immediate Next Steps (for IDE):

    Fix radar/pipeline/normalize.py: Add the slugify function.

    import re
    _SLUG_INVALID = re.compile(r"[^a-z0-9]+")
    _SLUG_DASHES = re.compile(r"-{2,}")

    def normalize_text(text: str) -> str: ...

    def slugify(value: str) -> str:
        v = (value or "").strip().lower()
        v = v.replace("_", "-").replace(" ", "-")
        v = _SLUG_INVALID.sub("-", v)
        v = _SLUG_DASHES.sub("-", v)
        v = v.strip("-")
        return v or "item"

    Fix radar/pipeline/render.py:
        Import slugify.
        Use id_slug = slugify(p.external_id) for both the filename (f"{id_slug}.md") and the permalink (f"/updates/.../{id_slug}/").
        Add permalink, lang, id_slug to the frontmatter.
    Run Verification:
        Execute python verify_v2.py (ensure verify_v2.py uses CliRunner to invoke the app).
        Verify that markdown files are generated in site/src/content/en/updates/....

Reference Files:

    radar/cli.py: Logic for major bump detection and weekly digest generation.
    site/src/pages/index.astro: Logic for linking to internal permalinks.

Good luck!
